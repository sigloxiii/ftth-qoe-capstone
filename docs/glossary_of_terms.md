# Glossary of Terms — FTTH QoE Risk Analysis

Reference for the standards, measurement concepts, network metrics, business concepts and data-engineering terms used in this project. Terms marked **(project)** have a specific meaning in this repository.

## 1. Standards & Regulatory Bodies

### International
- **ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union – Telecommunication Standardization Sector):** the ITU division that coordinates global telecommunication standards (e.g., the GPON recommendation G.984).
- **IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers):** professional association that develops networking standards (e.g., Ethernet, IEEE 802.3).
- **ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute):** independent non-profit organization that produces standards for information and communications technologies.

### United States
- **FCC (Federal Communications Commission):** the U.S. federal agency that regulates interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable.
- **MBA (Measuring Broadband America):** FCC program that collects and publishes performance data on fixed broadband services in the United States. Source of the data in this project.

### Mexico
- **CRT (Comisión Reguladora de Telecomunicaciones):** federal telecommunications regulator in Mexico. It replaced the IFT (Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones) under the new telecom framework, alongside the ATDT.
- **ATDT (Agencia de Transformación Digital y Telecomunicaciones):** federal agency created in the same restructuring that replaced the IFT.
- **PROFECO (Procuraduría Federal del Consumidor):** federal consumer protection agency; handles complaints about telecom services.
- **NOM (Norma Oficial Mexicana):** mandatory technical standards in Mexico for safety, performance and equipment compliance.
- **NYCE (Normalización y Certificación):** accredited organization that certifies equipment against Mexican standards.

## 2. Measurement & Data Source

- **SamKnows:** company whose measurement platform (Whitebox devices and software) is used by the FCC MBA program; the MBA documentation refers to SamKnows Whitebox hardware generations.
- **Whitebox:** the measurement device installed at a volunteer home and connected to the home network. Its model (e.g., `skwb8`, `ac1750v2`) is listed in the unit profile. **(project)** The Whitebox is the measurement *instrument*, so a model that cannot forward traffic at line rate distorts the results.
- **Unit (`unit_id`):** one deployed Whitebox, which identifies one participating household.
- **Panelist:** volunteer participant whose connection is measured (FCC terminology).
- **Unit profile:** FCC file with the details of each unit (ISP, technology, state, tier, Whitebox model, time-zone offsets).
- **Active measurement:** a test that generates its own traffic to measure the network (as opposed to passive monitoring of user traffic). All MBA tests used here are active.
- **Target:** the server or host a test is run against (`target` column).
- **On-net / Off-net node:** a test server inside the ISP's own network (on-net) or outside it (off-net). The MBA documentation states that one of each is tested hourly. **(project)** Whether to analyze them separately is a pending decision in the metrics specification.
- **Peak hours:** evening period with the highest network demand. **(project)** Defined here as local time 19:00–22:59; FCC reports describe an evening peak period, to be confirmed in the Technical Appendix.
- **UTC (Coordinated Universal Time):** the reference time standard. FCC `dtime` values are documented as UTC (with a documented exception for `curr_udpcloss`).
- **DST (Daylight Saving Time):** seasonal clock shift of one hour. It changes the UTC offset used to convert `dtime` into local time (`timezone_offset` vs `timezone_offset_dst`).
- **Provisioned speed / tier:** the download and upload speed contracted by the subscriber (`Download` / `Upload` columns, in Mbps).
- **CPE (Customer Premises Equipment):** equipment installed at the customer site (modem, router, ONT).
- **Line rate:** the maximum rate at which a device can forward traffic on an interface without loss.
- **HW NAT (hardware network address translation):** NAT performed by dedicated hardware instead of the CPU, which allows a router to keep high throughput. Devices without it can saturate at lower speeds.

## 3. Network Architecture & Infrastructure (FTTH / PON)

- **FTTH (Fiber to the Home):** architecture in which optical fiber runs from the central office directly to each residence.
- **PON (Passive Optical Network):** point-to-multipoint architecture that uses unpowered optical splitters so one fiber serves several premises.
- **GPON (Gigabit PON):** PON standard defined by ITU-T G.984, with up to 2.488 Gbps downstream and 1.244 Gbps upstream.
- **XGS-PON:** 10-Gigabit symmetrical PON standard defined by ITU-T G.9807.1.
- **OLT (Optical Line Terminal):** device at the provider's central office that connects the core network to the PON.
- **ONT / ONU (Optical Network Terminal / Unit):** customer-side device that converts optical signals to electrical signals.
- **ODN (Optical Distribution Network):** passive infrastructure (fibers, splitters, splice closures, connectors) between the OLT and the ONTs.

## 4. Network Performance Metrics (QoS)

- **QoS (Quality of Service):** objective, measurable network performance (bandwidth, delay, jitter, packet loss) managed by operators.
- **Latency:** the delay for a packet to travel across the network. It can be one-way or round-trip; the FCC MBA tests measure round-trip delay.
- **RTT (Round-Trip Time / tiempo de ida y vuelta):** time for a packet to travel from the source to the destination and back. In the data, `rtt_avg`, `rtt_min`, `rtt_max` and `rtt_std` are the average, minimum, maximum and standard deviation of the RTT in one test, in microseconds. **(project)** `p95_latency_ms` is built from `rtt_avg`.
- **Queuing delay:** time a packet waits in device queues. It grows with congestion and explains most of the hour-to-hour variation of RTT on a healthy fiber link.
- **Jitter:** variation of packet delay over time. It degrades real-time applications such as VoIP, video calls and gaming. The FCC documentation does not state the unit of `jitter_up` / `jitter_down`; the unit is verified in the data inspection.
- **Packet loss:** share of transmitted packets that never arrive. **(project)** In FCC MBA, a packet is counted as lost if no response arrives within 3 seconds, and loss is computed as `failures / (successes + failures)` from `curr_udplatency`.
- **Throughput:** rate of data actually delivered over a connection (Mbps or Gbps).
- **Bandwidth:** maximum capacity of a link or tier. Throughput is what is achieved; bandwidth is what is available.
- **Outage:** period in which connectivity is lost. In `curr_udpcloss.csv`, each row is an outage event with its `duration` and the number of packets lost (`packets`). **(project)**
- **Availability / uptime:** share of time a service is usable. Possible future metric built from outage events. **(project)**

## 5. Quality of Experience & Service Management

- **QoE (Quality of Experience):** overall acceptability of a service as perceived by the end user.
- **MOS (Mean Opinion Score):** rating from 1 (bad) to 5 (excellent) used to quantify perceived quality of voice, video or gaming.
- **KPI (Key Performance Indicator):** quantitative metric used to evaluate network or operational performance (e.g., latency, availability).
- **KQI (Key Quality Indicator):** indicator that reflects user perception of a specific service (e.g., video buffering time).
- **SLA / SLO (Service Level Agreement / Objective):** commitments on availability, latency and performance between a provider and a customer.
- **MTTR (Mean Time to Repair):** average time to troubleshoot and restore a failed network element or degraded service.

## 6. Risk Assessment (Project)

- **`risk_flag` (project):** 1 if a unit exceeds at least one threshold (latency, jitter or loss) during peak hours; 0 otherwise. Thresholds are parameters in `config.yaml`.
- **`risk_severe` (project):** second tier for extreme cases.
- **Threshold:** limit above which a metric marks a unit as at risk. Project-defined operating values, not attributed to a standard until verified in the source.
- **Sensitivity analysis:** reporting how results change when thresholds vary (e.g., latency × loss grid), instead of presenting a single arbitrary cut-off.
- **Risk score / risk index:** generic term for a calculated measure of the probability and impact of degradation. Not used in this project, which reports binary flags.

## 7. Financial & Operational Concepts

- **CAPEX (Capital Expenditure):** upfront spending to acquire, upgrade and maintain physical assets such as fiber, OLTs and splitters.
- **OPEX (Operational Expenditure):** recurring costs of running the network and business: maintenance, truck rolls, customer support, power.
- **Truck roll:** a technician dispatch to the customer site. A key OPEX driver.
- **ROI (Return on Investment):** profitability ratio used to evaluate an investment or strategy.
- **Churn rate:** percentage of subscribers who cancel in a period; often linked to poor QoE.
- **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User):** average revenue per active subscriber.

## 8. Data Engineering & Methodology

- **Data pipeline:** automated flow that ingests, cleans, transforms and loads data. **(project)** Here a batch pipeline: raw FCC CSV files → Parquet → unit-level metrics → Power BI.
- **ETL / ELT:** extract-transform-load (or load-then-transform) patterns for moving and preparing data.
- **Parquet:** columnar file format that is compact and fast for analytical queries.
- **DuckDB:** embedded analytical SQL database that can query CSV and Parquet files directly without loading them into memory.
- **Data lineage:** record of where data comes from and every transformation applied to it.
- **Data dictionary:** documentation of the meaning, type and unit of each column.
- **Data-quality log:** table that counts records discarded by each validation rule. **(project)**
- **Outlier:** value far from the rest of the data; it can be a real event or a data error and must be investigated before being removed.
- **Percentile (P50, P95):** value below which a given share of observations falls. P50 is the median; P95 describes the poorer end of the distribution.
- **Ratio of sums (weighted aggregation):** computing a rate as `sum(numerator) / sum(denominator)` instead of averaging per-row percentages, so each row counts in proportion to its size. **(project)** Used for loss because the number of packets varies by hour.
- **Reconciliation:** comparing two implementations of the same metric record by record to find where they differ. **(project)** Python vs Power BI, per `Unit ID`.
- **Convenience bias:** error from analyzing the data that is easiest to reach (e.g., the first rows of a file) instead of a representative sample. **(project)** Cause of the v1 failure.
- **Instrument bias:** error introduced by the measuring device itself. **(project)** Legacy Whiteboxes that cannot sustain line rate created false latency and loss in v2.
- **Power Query (M) / DAX:** Power BI languages for data transformation (Power Query) and calculated measures (DAX).
